# PHP Language Server Protocol adapter

_Under development, not yet stable!_

This aims to be a bridge between various PHP analysis tools and the Language Server Protocol.
It does _not_ aim to directly provide code analysis.

## Installation

(This won't work yet)

`composer require --dev firehed/lsphp`

## Usage

Usage varies heavily on your editor.
Generally speaking, you will need to register `vendor/bin/lsphp` as a binary to start a Language Server.

## Compatible tools

None yet

### Coming Soon

* `php -l`
* PHP_CodeSniffer
